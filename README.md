# XervishUI
A highly opinionated minimalist UI

## FAQ
**Q: Erm, where's the configuration?**

There isn't any! This is a highly opinionated UI suite that I use. I wrote it for my own use, because I don't like having four hundred and eighty five addons. You can customise some values in `Modules/Defaults`, as well as more specific configuration in individual Modules.

**Q: What is included?**

* Unit Frames (Player, Pet, Target, ToT, Raid DPS, Raid Healer, Boss Frames)
* Minimap Styling
* Opinionated Defaults
* Slim Data Text Bar up the top
* Misc Layout Stuff

**Q: What is NOT included**
* Action Bars. Either use the default Blizzard ones, or set up your own to your own liking.

**Q: Do you recommend other addons?**
* [Parrot 2](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/parrot2)
* [Bartender 4](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bartender4)
* [Masque](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/masque)
* [Masque Skinner for Blizzard Buffs](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/blizzbuffsfacade)
* A Masque skin of your choice

## Fonts!
Included in this addon is `Fonts/ExpresswayFree.ttf`. If you place this file in `$install/_retail_/Fonts`, copy it 3 times, then rename each file to the following:
* `ARIALN.ttf`
* `FRIZQT__.ttf` (note the double underscore here)
* `MORPHEUS.ttf`
* `SKURRI.ttf`
... then you'll get nicer fonts in game without using an extra addon.
