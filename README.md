# XervishUI
A highly opinionated minimalist UI

## FAQ
**Q: Erm, where's the configuration?**

There isn't any! This is a highly opinionated UI suite that I use. I wrote it for my own use, because I don't like having four hundred and eighty five addons. You can customise some values in `Modules/Defaults`, as well as more specific configuration in individual Modules.

**Q: What Unit Frames are provided?**

There's a centered grid for healer specs, and a left aligned minimal list for tank / DPS specs. Self, Pet, Target, Target of Target are all supported, as are Boss Frames.

## This addon also supports:
* Masque

## Fonts!
Included in this addon is `Fonts/ExpresswayFree.ttf`. If you place this file in `$install/_retail_/Fonts`, copy it 3 times, then rename each file to the following:
* `ARIALN.ttf`
* `FRIZQT__.ttf` (note the double underscore here)
* `MORPHEUS.ttf`
* `SKURRI.ttf`

... then you'll get nicer fonts in game without using an extra addon.
